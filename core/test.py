    """Execute pipe in test context with controlled configuration.

    Runs a single pipe with provided config and state, configuring runtime
    with test arguments and environment. Yields modified state for assertions.

    Args:
        name: Fully qualified pipe name.
        config: Configuration dictionary for the pipe.
        state: Initial state dictionary (copied before execution).
        logger: Logger instance.
        arguments: Command-line arguments for runtime.
        environment: Environment variables for runtime.
        in_memory_state: If True, set runtime.in-memory-state flag.
        dry_run: If True, execute in dry-run mode.

    Yields:
        Modified state dictionary after pipe execution.

    Example::

        with test.run(
            "my.pipe",
            {"threshold": 10},
            {"data": [1, 2, 3]},
